# BirbBot
A small telegram bot that downloads pictures of birbs from the /r/birbs subreddit and delivers them to users via the  /birb command

Other subreddits can be added via the '/add subreddit [handle]' command. The handle will determine the folder and the command with which the new content will be retrieved.

'/add pics pictures' would result in any user being able to get images from the /pics subreddit via the '/pictures' command

To use, add your reddit and telegram app credentials in the prefs file.
